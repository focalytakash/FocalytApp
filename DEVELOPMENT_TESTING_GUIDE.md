# 🧪 Development Testing Guide

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

The "Network request failed" error has been resolved by implementing mock API responses for development and testing.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ❌ **Previous Issue:**
- App was trying to make real network requests to `YOUR_API_ENDPOINT`
- This caused "Network request failed" errors
- No backend server was available for testing

### ✅ **Current Solution:**
- Implemented mock API responses for development
- All network calls now return successful mock responses
- App can be tested without a backend server

## 🚀 How to Test the App

### 1. **Start the App**
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

### 2. **Grant Permissions**
- ✅ **Camera Permission** - Allow when prompted
- ✅ **Location Permission** - Allow when prompted
- ✅ **Storage Permission** - Allow when prompted

### 3. **Test Punch In**
1. Tap the **"PUNCH IN"** button
2. Take a photo when camera opens
3. Allow location access
4. Wait for success message
5. Check that tracking starts

### 4. **Test Punch Out**
1. Tap the **"PUNCH OUT"** button
2. Take a photo when camera opens
3. Allow location access
4. Wait for success message
5. Check session statistics

## 📊 What You'll See

### **Console Logs (Development)**
```
📤 Simulating attendance record save to server...
✅ Attendance record saved successfully (mock)
📤 Simulating location data send to server...
✅ Location sent to server successfully (mock)
📤 Simulating session data save to server...
✅ Session data saved successfully (mock)
```

### **UI Indicators**
- ✅ **Green status** when checked in
- ✅ **Working hours timer** running
- ✅ **Location tracking active** indicator
- ✅ **Battery optimized** status
- ✅ **Offline data count** (0 when online)

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Normal Operation**
- ✅ Punch in with photo
- ✅ Location tracking starts
- ✅ Background tracking works
- ✅ Punch out with statistics

### 2. **Permission Testing**
- ✅ Camera permission denied → Error message
- ✅ Location permission denied → Error message
- ✅ Permission granted → Success

### 3. **Offline Testing**
- ✅ Turn off network
- ✅ Punch in/out still works
- ✅ Data stored locally
- ✅ Turn network back on → Auto sync

### 4. **Background Testing**
- ✅ Minimize app
- ✅ Location tracking continues
- ✅ Bring app back → Status updates

## 🔍 Debug Information

### **Check Console Logs**
```javascript
// Look for these success messages:
✅ Geocoder initialized successfully
✅ Modern Location Tracker initialized successfully
✅ Enhanced services initialized
✅ Background timer started
✅ Location watching started
✅ Attendance record saved successfully (mock)
```

### **Check App State**
- **Tracking Status**: Active/Inactive
- **Session Info**: Session ID, duration, locations
- **Offline Data**: Number of pending records
- **Battery Status**: Optimized/Not optimized

## 🛠️ Development Features

### **Mock API Responses**
All network calls now return successful mock responses:
- ✅ Attendance records saved
- ✅ Location data uploaded
- ✅ Session data saved
- ✅ Photo uploads successful

### **Simulated Delays**
Realistic network delays for testing:
- 📤 Attendance save: 1 second
- 📤 Location upload: 0.5 seconds
- 📤 Session save: 0.8 seconds
- 📤 Photo upload: 1.2 seconds

### **Test Data**
- 🧪 Test user: "Test User" (EMP001)
- 🧪 Test location: Delhi coordinates
- 🧪 Test photo: Mock photo data
- 🧪 Test session: Auto-generated session ID

## 🔄 Switching to Real API

When you're ready to connect to a real backend:

### 1. **Update API Endpoints**
```javascript
// In src/config/apiConfig.js
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-real-api.com/api/v1';
```

### 2. **Uncomment Real API Calls**
```javascript
// In src/utils/enhancedAttendanceService.js
// Remove mock code and uncomment real API calls
const response = await fetch('YOUR_API_ENDPOINT/attendance', {
  // ... real API call
});
```

### 3. **Test with Real Backend**
- ✅ Deploy your backend server
- ✅ Update API endpoints
- ✅ Test with real data
- ✅ Monitor network calls
